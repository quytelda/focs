What is FOCS?
-------------

FOCS is a data structure library implemented in C, designed to provide common data structures to C programs.  Additionally, FOCS aims to provide a functional programming bent to these data structures providing common functional utilities like ``map`` and ``foldr/foldl`` that can be used with any of these data structures.
