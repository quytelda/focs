Obtaining FOCS
==============

Git
---

FOCS is very new and still under heavy development; there have not yet been any versioned releases. To obtain a copy of focs, either clone or download the master branch of the focs repository (located at https://github.com/quytelda/focs.git). For example::

  $ git clone https://github.com/quytelda/focs.git
  Cloning into 'focs'...
  ...
  $ cd focs

All commits and tags are PGP signed as of 2018/5/1.  You can have git show PGP signatures on individual commits using ``git log --show-signatures``.  All releases will have a corresponding tag, which is signed using GnuPG.

Source Archive

Pre-packaged source releases are listed at https://github.com/quytelda/focs/releases.
